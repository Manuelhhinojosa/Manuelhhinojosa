<h2 align="center"> Hi 👋  </h2>
<h2 align="center">I'm Manuel H Hinojosa</h2>
<h3 align="center">I am a Full Stack Web Developer.</h3>
<p align="center"> 🔭 Currently looking for new job opportunities.</p>

  
<p align="justify"> With a passion for technology and a drive for innovation, I transitioned from a successful career in culinary management and event planning to become a Full Stack Software Engineer.

My background in gastronomy and event planning has given me a unique approach to web development, allowing me to infuse creativity, meticulous attention to detail, and a user-centered mindset into every project I undertake.

I have hands-on experience in building and deploying dynamic, responsive web applications using the MERN stack, and I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering elegant, scalable solutions. My journey from crafting memorable experiences in the culinary world to developing impactful digital experiences has equipped me with a fresh perspective, blending technical expertise with a deep understanding of client needs and project management. Whether I'm building a seamless user interface or engineering a robust backend, my goal is to create meaningful and efficient digital solutions that leave a lasting impression. </p>
